# Bass Guitar Music Theory

This repo hosts my final year project - an app to teach basic music theory for the bass guitar. Some very basic knowledge is assumed as the app is intended as a learning aid and is *not* a replacement for more detailed lessons.

See [the todo list](todo.md) for future development goals.

## Exercises

### Notes on the Fretboard
This exercise randomly selects a fret and asks which note it is. Make a selection with the buttons at the bottom and the app will grade your performance.

### Intervals
This exercise randomly selects an interval from the root note (highlighted in red). Make a selection by clicking or tapping on a fret marker.

### Scales
Select the desired scale and key from the settings page and the exercise will randomly select a note & interval in that scale. Choose the correct position of this note by clicking or tapping on a fret marker. The root note in the scale is highlighted in red.
