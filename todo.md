# Todo

In (rough) order: 

- Better highscore tracking:
    - Build a high scores page (replacing clear data link)
    - Track per time limit ?
    - Add percentage as well as raw score
    - Use JSON in localstorage instead of just ints
- Namespace shared code so it is easier to see where functions & variables originate
- Use a library for timers
- Update KineticJS version or switch to Konva
- Switch to 'use strict'
- Add help when clicking a note in the notes exercise
- Improve visuals of exercises
- Refactor things so code is easier to follow
- Shorter range of exercise lengths (e.g. 30 seconds - 5 mins)
- Fix pluralisation in settings pages
