# Todo

In (rough) order: 

- Fix display order of start button Intervals exercise page
- Namespace shared code so it is easier to see where functions & variables originate
- Better highscore tracking:
    - Build a high scores page (replacing clear data link)
    - Track per time limit
    - Add percentage as well as raw score
    - Use JSON in localstorage instead of just ints
- Shorter range of exercise lengths (e.g. 30 seconds - 5 mins)
- Improve visuals of exercises
- Update KineticJS version or switch to Konva
- Refactor things so code is easier to follow
- Fix pluralisation in settings pages
- Use a library for timers
- Switch to 'use strict'
